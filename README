github-service-wrapper
======================

If you have a git project, that you want to run on an Debian derived server
(like Raspbian), and which you want to auto-update on restart of the server,
this script will help.

It will fetch the git repository into PATH, and create an init script to
update an run it using the specified command.

If you want to change the command options, you can rerun the setup script at
any time.

After a service has been setup, you can control it with:
  /etc/init.d/<name> start
  /etc/init.d/<name> stop
  /etc/init.d/<name> restart
  /etc/init.d/<name> status
